in this example used the desert tiled map taken from http://www.mapeditor.org/index.html
I strongly suggest you to try the Tiled map editor, it is very good and open source

This simple project is used as an example in this tutorial http://lowcoupling.com/post/67280697179/using-tiled-maps-in-libgdx
